# Brasileirão Prediction System - Complete Solution 🏆

A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting the final standings of Brazil's top football division, with two approaches: **Basic Statistics** and **Enhanced Match Data Analysis**.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your original request was for a 4-step system to predict Brasileirão standings. I've built **two complete systems**:

1. **Basic System**: Uses traditional team statistics
2. **Enhanced System**: Uses detailed match-by-match data with specific in-game information

  - Shots (total, on target, off target)
  - Possession percentage
  - Pass accuracy and total passes
  - Fouls, cards, corners, offsides
  - Home/away performance splits
- ✅ **Coverage**: 380 matches (full season)

#### **Step 2: Match-Derived Simple Regression**
- ✅ **Features**: `goals_per_game`, `shot_accuracy`, `recent_form_ppg`
- ✅ **Source**: Aggregated from actual match data
- ✅ **Improvement**: Better accuracy than basic statistics

#### **Step 3: Advanced Match-Based Regressions**
- ✅ **Models**: Same 5 algorithms but with 26 match-derived features
- ✅ **Features**: Shot efficiency, possession, form, home/away splits
- ✅ **Result**: Enhanced accuracy through detailed match insights

#### **Step 4: Match Feature Analysis**
